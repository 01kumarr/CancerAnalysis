# Personalized Cancer Analysis
### Data Sources: https://www.kaggle.com/c/msk-redefining-cancer-treatment

These data source includes two files: One contains Genetic Mutations/Variation and other contains the clinical text data that humans experts/pathologies use to classifiy the genetic mutations

Both these files have common ID

DATA FILES INFORMATION:
  training_variants(ID, Gene, Variation, Class)
  training_text(ID, Text)
  
  
MAtching this problems with machine learning, it is a multiclass-classification that has class labels 1 to 9

Model need to predict the class label based on clinical text

This would reduce the human effort drastically, as it takes thousands of hour to classify gene/variation mutation as a certain class
